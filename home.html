                    My name is Xi Li,I love music since I was a child. When I was in junior high school, I joined our
                    schoolâ€™s orchestra. By chance, our orchestra would perform abroad on behalf of the school.

                    This opportunity to study abroad left a deep impression on me and stimulated my curiosity about the outside
                    world. Therefore, I set a lifelong goal: I want to study abroad and settle overseas.
                </p>
                <p id="para2">
                    When I was 21 years old, i came to BC province, Canada to study at University.
                    I graduated with Bachelor degree in Finance major at Thompson Rivers University,BC on 2015.
                    After graduated, I moved to Halifax and ran a business for 3 years. In these three years, I learned how to
                    maximize profits through strong teamwork and how to resolve guest complaints.
                    Therefore, the profits increase year by year. At the same time, i accumulated lots of business experience.
                    I am sure that I have enough experience and ability in this field.

                    My character is a passionate, positive, outgoing, enthusiastic and ambitious person who loves my life. I have a

                    my family and my friends. 
                    I love traveling with friends, I like the culture of different countries and would like to taste different food for countries. <br />
                    I am also willing to challenge myself and learn knowledge in different fields. I love new things and set another
                    new goal for myself which is enter electronics industry.
                </p>

                    I realized that electronic devices and the Internet have become necessary and inreplaceable part in daily
                    life.
                    So I would like to keep up with the pace of information age to learn more. This is why am I here as freshman
                    student in IT Web Programming at Nova Scotia Community College.<br /><br />
